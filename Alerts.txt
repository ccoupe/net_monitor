----> HE notify if systems not responding (device & reason[s]) Use influx
        monitoring db? Kapacitor has  publish to Mqtt (amoung others)
      1. Check if Pi4 running and MQTT running (pings?). 
        Do this from HE. Notify cell phone. 
      2. Check if Linux and mini systems are running (influx/kapacitor)
        send status to mqtt. HE will read topic, Notify cell...
----> use grafana/influxdb for device 'health' monitoring and notification?
      - Kodi needs influx collector.
      
~/Projects/iot/alerts/mqtt-netbase.py, mqtt-netbase.groovy 

1. Base Level: Bronco up, pi4 up, mqtt up, hubitat up.
  Settings
    "every_seconds": 120
    "ping_list":["192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.5", "192.168.1.7"]
    "hubitat": "192.168.1.5"
    "mqtt_ip": "192.168.1.7"
    "mqtt_root": "homie/network"
    "mqtt_base": "status/basic"     # is a property, root+base/set
    "mqtt_tb" "status/tb"           # is a property so + /set
  Script runs on brono. duplicate runs on pi4.
      connect to mqtt. 
      set on_message handler for f"{mqtt_root}/{mqtt_base}/cmd"
      forever: :
        foreach settings.ping_list ping, collect ip# and ping status.
        write ping status[s] to f"{mqtt_root}/{mqtt_base}/set" payload: {"up": ["ip", ...]}
        set 30 sec timer
        wait(settings.every_seconds)
      on_message: 
        if payload == "{"ack": true}, cancel timer
      if tmo fires
        attempt email.
        set an mqtt topic? http post to hubitat?
        
  Hubitat - cjcnet.groovy driver listens to {mqtt_root}/{mqtt_base}/set
  
     when {"up": [] } arrives, 
      if up.list.length=3 
        send "{"ack": true}
        set virt_contact to closed
      else
        set virt_contact to open
        
      HSM listens for the virt_contact 
      
2. All nodes ping and/or all telegrafs are sending.

3. TrumpyBear is alive
    want an send/rcv interaction

4. MqttCameras are happy
    want an send/rcv interaction

5. Warnings if load average is too high.
